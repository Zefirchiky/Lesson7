    <h1 align=center>Telegram</h1>
<h2>Telegram is a cross-platform cloud-based instant messaging, video calling,[16] and VoIP service. It was first launched for iOS on 14 August 2013. Users of Telegram can send messages and exchange photos, videos, stickers, audio, and files of any type up to 2 GB each.

    Telegram apps are available for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux in addition to a web app.[17]
    
    As of April 2020, Telegram had 400 million monthly active users.[18][19] The service originated in Russia in 2013 and is currently based in Dubai.[20][21][22]
    
    The default messages and media use client-server encryption during transit.[23][24] This data is also encrypted at rest, but can be accessed by Telegram developers, who hold the encryption keys. In addition Telegram provides end-to-end encrypted calls[25] and optional end-to-end encrypted "secret" chats between two online users on smartphone clients. However, the desktop clients (excluding macOS client) do not feature end-to-end encryption, nor is end-to-end encryption available for groups, supergroups, or channels. Telegram has defended the lack of ubiquitous end-to-end encryption by claiming the online-backups that do not use client-side encryption are "the most secure solution currently possible".</h2>
